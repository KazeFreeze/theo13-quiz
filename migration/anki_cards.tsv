ones, meaning that the mere cessation\
of bad deeds is not enough to gain\
pardon.<br>B: It is impossible to change a choice\
once it has been made, which entails\
that at least some sins can never be\
forgiven.<br>C: Choice is an illusion, since a person&#x27;s\

<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.A. Freedom and Conscience (1.3. Conscience: Knowledge of Moral Truth)<br><b>Question:</b> Catholics should form their consciences in accordance with Church teaching because:<br><br>A: Faith teaches that Jesus Christ entrusted the sacred pastors with authority to teach in his name; thus, Church teachings are to be received, not as human doctrines, but as the word of God.<br>B: Catholics have been socialized in the religious traditions of their parents and so cannot conceive of right or wrong apart from the categories proposed by the Church and its representatives.<br>C: Especially regarding matters of politics and economics (though less so those of sexual morality), Church teaching is supported by empirical data and aligns with the conclusions social sciences.<br>D: All of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> Faith teaches that Jesus<br>Christ entrusted the sacred<br>pastors with authority to<br>teach in his name; thus,<br>Church teachings are to be<br>received, not as human<br>doctrines, but as the word of<br>God.<br>See Fulfillment in Christ, pp.<br>35-36; Second Vatican<br>Council, Constitution Dei<br>Verbum, para. 10.

morality and many of the practical\
possibilities for acting uprightly.<br>B: Society is continually progressing,\
which requires us to correct or unlearn\
many old ideas about morality for the\

<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.A. Freedom and Conscience<br><b>Question:</b> On the basis of a Catholic understanding of conscience, one would most likely say Raymark:<br><br>A: Did not sin, since all religions are equally valid; thus, one can appeal to other faith traditions to legitimate doing what one&#x27;s own forbids.<br>B: Did not sin, since life is the most important human good, and the necessity of serving it relieves a person of any conflicting moral duties.<br>C: Sinned, for although it is not objectively sinful to eat dinuguan, Raymark believed that it was, thus violating his conscience by eating it.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The erroneous conscience always obliges, provided that one has made an honest effort to dispel the error before coming to a decision; see Fulfillment in Christ, pp. 30-32.

<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.A. Freedom and Conscience<br><b>Question:</b> The superego, or the interiorized sense of right and wrong absorbed from authority figures, is not the same as conscience, since:<br><br>A: The conscience is one&#x27;s self-constructed moral code, while the superego is externally imposed, limiting rather than enhancing personal freedom.<br>B: The superego does not necessarily conform to social standards, resulting in cases of antisocial behavior<br>C: The superego has no essential connection to moral truth, often causing people to act neurotically, in ways which subvert their human fulfillment.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br><b>Explanation:</b>

<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> According to Grisez, basic human goods are &quot;good&quot; in the sense that:<br><br>A: They are imbued with moral value, hence their realization is always and per se morally good.<br>B: Social convention approves them as being desirable, and their contraries as bad or undesirable,<br>C: Their realization tends to promote the fulfillment of human persons, making them desirable.<br>D: All of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> See FC, 50-51, 54-56
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> As a basic human good, marriage may be classified as:<br><br>A: Sensible, since marriage is desirable as a means to achieving psychological and physical pleasure<br>B: Substantive, since it fulfills the natural capacity of men and women to conceive and rear children.<br>C: Existential, since spouses give themselves freely to constitute a harmonious marital relationship.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> See FC, p. 56. Marriage begins with the exchange of consent and is invalid without it. Insofar as the making and resolute persistence in this choice fulfills humans as beings capable of making choice, marriage is an existential good.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> An example of a person who realizes substantive goods without realizing existential goods could be:<br><br>A: A priest, terminally ill with stomach cancer, who perseveres in his pastoral charge although tormented by his perceived failures.<br>B: A powerful businessman, handsome and in peak physical condition, who engages in lurid acts of sexual depravity and violence<br>C: A former criminal who reforms his life, prospers in business, and forgives those who persecuted him instead of taking revenge.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> This is Patrick Bateman from American Psycho.

The acts of carnage in which he indulges prevent him from realizing the existential good of justice, while his concealing these acts is a kind of inauthenticity.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> Grisez argues that being a good person without qualification is primarily about realizing basic human goods, such as:<br><br>A: Health, wealth, and education, since no higher goods can be attained without first realizing them<br>B: Harmony in one&#x27;s choices and relationships, since these bear most directly upon moral goodness.<br>C: Political liberty, since social injustice and structural sin impede the realization of existential goods.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> FC, pp.57-59.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B.

<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> The statement which best expresses the Catholic theological tradition&#x27;s understanding of the relationship between good and bad is:<br><br>A: &quot;God exists, and God is good; therefore, the Devil exists as the embodiment of badness, since there can be no light without darkness.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Bad is not a thing and has no being of its own; thus, badness is like darkness, which we understand only with reference to light.&quot;<br>C: &quot;Good and bad complement one another and create harmony, just as we need darkness so we are not blinded by an excess of light.&quot;<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> B<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> See FC, p. 50.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> The statement, ____, is a concrete example of the proper response to badness proposed by Grisez.<br><br>A: &quot;Even if our conscience accuses us of sin, we may always approach the sacraments confident that God will overlook any of our misdeeds.&quot;<br>B: &quot;Expecting public sinners to repent before receiving the sacraments is wrong because it is exclusionary and causes them mental anguish.&quot;<br>C: &quot;Because it is spiritually harmful to receive the Eucharist unworthily, those conscious of grave sin must go to confession before receiving.&quot;<br>D: None of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> This is the way of redemption, which heals and reconciles sinners with a view to their salvation; see FC, p. 54. See Code of Canon Law, can. 916; cf. 1 Cor. 11:27-32.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> Those who promise to contribute certain deliverables for a group project, but through negligence and procrastination fail to deliver them, fail to realize the goods of:<br><br>A: Skillful performance, since they have not worked to the best of their ability, but generated inferior outputs.<br>B: Justice, since they assumed obligations to their groupmates which they failed to fulfill through free choices.<br>C: Practical authenticity, since their judgments of conscience were not implemented through external action.<br>D: All of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> 
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.B. Good and Bad<br><b>Question:</b> If every agent acts in view of a real or apparent good, then morally evil choices:<br><br>A: Can exist, since not every particular good we desire necessarily leads us to true fulfillment.<br>B: Cannot exist, since divine grace prevents those who believe in Christ from committing sins.<br>C: Can exist, to the extent that people renounce creativity and acquiesce to the will of others.<br>D: None of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> See FC, pp. 50-51.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.5. A Critique of Proportionalism<br><b>Question:</b> In the &quot;Trolley Problem,&quot; a runaway trolley will strike and kill five people unless it is diverted; however, if it is diverted, it will strike and kill one person who was not in danger until then. A proportionalist would likely say the morally correct thing to do in this scenario would be to:<br><br>A: Intervene, since the death of one is an adverse side effect accepted as the cost of saving the five, which is the best that one can do in the situation.<br>B: Do not intervene, since one is not involved in the situation until one acts; but any positive action would violate the moral norm prohibiting killing.<br>C: Intervene, since the death of one can be willed as a means to avert the death of five, thereby realizing a greater good and avoiding a greater evil.<br>D: None of the above.	<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> Here, intervention is framed as murder, albeit justified as a means to achieving a good outcome. This is proportionalism. See FC, pp. 61-63; cf. pp. 73-74, regarding the deleterious effects of proportionalist reasoning on moral creativity.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.5. A Critique of Proportionalism<br><b>Question:</b> Some proportionalists propose goods can be compared rationally with reference to community standards, which transcend individual preference. A difficulty with this proposal is that:<br><br>A: Morality is highly contextual, depending more on intuitions than abstract principles that cannot account for the complexity of concrete cases calling for a Christian response<br>B: Morality depends upon the will of God, which he can change arbitrarily; thus, a standard upholding marital fidelity would become evil if ever God decided to command adultery.<br>C: Every human society is tainted to some extent by the effects of sin, which distort its moral priorities and preclude facile invocations of its standards as guides to right conduct<br>D: All of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> See FC,p. 70.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.5. A Critique of Proportionalism<br><b>Question:</b> Proportionalism seems plausible for various reasons, including that:<br><br>A: In everyday life, people explain clearly good moral choices in terms of realizing a greater good or avoiding a greater evil.<br>B: Its insistence on choosing the lesser evil where there are no good options seems to account for exceptions to moral norms.<br>C: Human goods can be compared on the basis of personal preferences, but no rational standard exists for weighing them.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> 
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.5. A Critique of Proportionalism<br><b>Question:</b> The statement, _____, is an example of proportionalist reasoning in application.<br><br>A: &quot;While marital permanence is a fine ideal, it can and should be set aside when infidelity or neglect have destroyed marital communion, so the parties can try to find happiness anew.&quot;<br>B: &quot;In treating cases of ectopic pregnancy,it is better to cut out the embryo directly rather than remove the whole fallopian tube, since this will minimize damage to the mother&#x27;s fertility&#x27;&quot;<br>C: &quot;All else being equal, the consecrated state is superior to the married state as a form of Christian life, since it involves a more intentional, singlehearted pursuit of Christian perfection&#x27;&quot;<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> 
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> 1.5. A Critique of Proportionalism<br><b>Question:</b> To say, as Grisez does, that basic human goods are incommensurable means that:<br><br>A: Basic human goods of different categories cannot be ranked or compared with one another; i.e., there is no rational standard for privileging the good of life over that of truth.<br>B: Instantiations of the same basic good cannot be ranked or compared with one another; i.e. there is no rational standard for privileging the good of Jhomar&#x27;s life over Einjhel&#x27;s.<br>C: When deciding what to do, either the greater good or the lesser evil is always to be preferred; e.g.,killing one innocent man is morally right if it saves the lives of many people.<br>D: Option 1 and Option 2	<b>Correct Answer:</b> D<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> 
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> Unknown<br><b>Question:</b> Grisez critiques proportionalism for undermining the creativity which should characterize the moral life, by which he means:<br><br>A: Proportionalists are unduly focused on universal moral norms, which they say must be observed always, everywhere, and by all; but moral standards are personal constructs, neither fixed nor objective in nature.<br>B: Proportionalism argues that one should prefer the greater good or the lesser evil without explaining why this should be so; but no one is bound to always prefer what is best, and one can freely choose what is worst.<br>C: The types of moral calculations involved in proportionalist analysis require the simplification of complex situations, promoting binary thinking and preoccupation with more easily quantified substantive goods.<br>D: None of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> C<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The types of moral calculations involved in proportionalist analysis require the simplification of complex situations, promoting binary thinking and preoccupation with more easily quantified substantive goods. See FC, pp. 72-74.
<b>Module:</b> Module 1: Principles of Moral Theology<br><b>Section:</b> Unknown<br><b>Question:</b> Grisez argues proportionalism fails as an ethical theory because it rests on unrealistic assumptions, including that:<br><br>A: The consequences of one’s choices can be foreknown and compared in their totality, which presupposes omniscience on the part of the moral agent,<br>B: Moral rectitude requires that one&#x27;s will be open to the realization of all goods in all persons, although the Bible approves of xenophobia and misogyny.<br>C: Divine revelation and Catholic teaching, neither of which can be proven empirically, provide a reliable basis for evaluating the moral quality of choices.<br>D: All of the above	<b>Correct Answer:</b> A<br><br><b>Explanation:</b> The consequences of one’s choices can be foreknown and compared in their totality, which presupposes omniscience on the part of the moral agent,.
