      "choices": {
        "A": "Sin, being a disruption of our relationship with God, is a spiritual phenomenon with no bearing on bodily health.",
        "B": "Sin presupposes choice, and choices determine the one who chooses even if he or she is not troubled by them.",

But, '\"As I live; declares the Lord, 'I do not desire the death of the sinner, but that he be converted and saved\"' (Ez. 33:11; cf. Lk. 15). This statement evokes the argument for proportionalism predicated on God's power to draw good from evil, presented and debunked in chapter 6 (see FC, p. 67). "

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "While subjective factors such as the mental toll of stress or extreme emotion may render an otherwise mortal sin merely venial, such factors cannot alter the objective gravity of the sin itself. To illustrate, murder is always gravely wrong because it involves direct hostility to the good of human life, but murders in \"hot\" blood (Le., crimes of passion, such as a man who kills another man he caught having sex with his wife) do not involve the same premeditation as those in \"cold\" blood (Le., lying in ambush to kill an enemy), and are less imputable to malice.\n\nSee FC, pp. 189, 192.

      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "Revisionists do maintain that our discrete choices are less than fully free, though they are not deterministic as this option implies. Rather, they say discrete choices are not fully determinative because prior ones determine the possibilities available for those that follow. Thus they postulate the existence of a hypothetical absolute or transcendental freedom, Le., a \"fundamental option\" directly for or against God, exercised unconsciously at the core of one's being."

Although separated, spouses remain bound by important moral obligations toward one another. This includes the obligation of keeping faith, which precludes new romantic or sexual relationships, including remarriage (see LL 16:18).\n\n\"Meekness is...lacking in a Church in which some lay people want to function as if they were priests, [and] some priests as if they were lay people;\" see FC, p. 307. Administrative work is incidental to a priest's vocation and pastoral charge, not central. Qualified laypersons (e.g., accountants, engineers, attorneys) can assist priests in carrying out this work, which does not require the power of orders conferred by means of the sacrament of ordination.

      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Christ founded the Catholic Church and proposed membership in it as a means to salvation; see Jn. 6:68. Rejection by one's fellow believers is indeed a hardship of the sort which would strongly tempt someone in Darwin's situation to leave the Catholic Church, or the practice of religion altogether. While the Lord Jesus gravely censures those who give scandal (Le., undermining the faith of others; see Mt. 18:6), nonetheless he desires that all be saved; see Ezek. 33:11.\n\nMCR7 is also relevant to this situation. Hostility and sinfulness among one's fellow believers does not nullify the role of the Church in our spiritual lives, for we, too, are conscious of our sinfulness and need for God's mercy. See Nit. 18:21-35, in which the Lord Jesus commands us to forgive our fellow believers who sin against us and illustrates this by a parable."

      "question": "Patricia is a Catholic in a stable, romantic, domestic relationship with another woman. Modes of Christian Response potentially relevant to her personal vocation may include:",
      "choices": {
        "A": "MCR7, inasmuch as she should be ready to meet unfair criticism of her relationship not with hostility, but with a spirit of forgiveness.",
        "B": "MCR2, inasmuch as her orientation excludes a vocation to marriage, which the Catholic Church teaches to be intrinsically heterosexual.",
        "C": "MRC5, inasmuch as she should bear patiently with her partner, be attentive to her needs, and go beyond mere fairness in caring for her.",
        "D": "All of the above"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "Unfair criticism in this context would include baseless suppositions, e.g., that Patricia had fallen away from the Catholic faith because of her relationship, that her partner was a bad influence upon heq or that the relationship is sexual in nature merely because the parties are lesbians. None of these need be the case and should not be assumed (e.g., the fact of a man and a woman dating is not grounds to infer they are sexually active, so it seems unfair to draw this conclusion from the fact of two men or two women being in a similar relationship).\n\nFair criticism should always be considered thoughtfully, in a spirit of humility. If, for example, the aforesaid suppositions were grounded in evidence, or if the relationship were abusive, then it would be wrong not to pay heed."
